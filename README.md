# Player Behavior Analytics

**Player Behavior Analytics** is a Python-based desktop application created as part of an engineering thesis.  
The tool is designed to analyze, visualize, and interpret player behavior data collected from computer games and digital distribution platforms.

The application combines classic data analysis techniques with interactive visualizations and AI-assisted interpretation of results.
